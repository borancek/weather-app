This project was completed during my undergraduate degree and is one of my early attempts at coding.<br/>
It may not adhere to the highest coding standards, but it represents a significant milestone in my journey as a developer.<br/>
I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement on this project, as well as on my coding journey in general.<br/>          
Feel free to share your insights with me as I continue to learn and grow as a developer.<br/>

# weather-app
<br/>
This project is a simple weather application designed to automatically detect the user's location and deliver real-time weather updates for their specific location through the use of the openWeather API.<br/> 
In addition to providing accurate weather information, this application also incorporates data visualization. For example, when the weather conditions indicate snowfall,<br/> 
a corresponding snow icon will be displayed alongside the name of the user's current city, enhancing the overall user experience.<br/>
<br/>
Below, you'll find a visual representation of the application in action:<br/>

 **Technologies Used**: 
- **What I Learned**: Working on this project taught me the significance of user experiences and underscored the critical importance of designing applications that are intuitively user-friendly.
- **Challenges**: I encountered various challenges during this project such as how to implement APIs, and though I've come a long way since then, I'm still proud of the effort I put into it.
- **What I Can Improve**: I aspire to incorporate an additional functionality that enables users to search for weather information in various locations of their choice.
