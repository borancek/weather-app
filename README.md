This project was one of my early attempts at coding, undertaken during my initial days of learning how to develop software. 
It may not adhere to the highest coding standards, but it represents a significant milestone in my journey as a developer.  
I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement on this project, as well as on my coding journey in general.          
Feel free to share your insights with me as I continue to learn and grow as a developer.                                    


# weather-app

This project is a simple weather application designed to automatically detect the user's location and deliver real-time weather updates for their specific location through the use of the openWeather API. 
In addition to providing accurate weather information, this application also incorporates data visualization. For example, when the weather conditions indicate snowfall, 
a corresponding snow icon will be displayed alongside the name of the user's current city, enhancing the overall user experience.
Below, you'll find a visual representation of the application in action:
